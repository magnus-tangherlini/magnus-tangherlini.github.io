The following code is quite confusing but the two main important files are the code.ipynb and the nerf.ipynb

code.ipynb was used for parts 0 and 1. Part 0 it was used for pre-processing the images, calibrating the camera, and creating the dataset.
There might be quite redundant code, especially when it comes to having to save the downsampled images. However, I was too lazy to actually go 
back and change the workflow.

nerf.ipynb was used to actually train the model. The most important thing to do when changing hyperparameters is to change near and far
in the function sample_along_rays. I accidentally hardcoded in values, but all you need to do is change the default values and it should be fine.

Most of the files are not completely used here, however I'm not totally sure which ones are. In the future I will do a better job of keeping track.
For now, just look at the website in order to understand the code.
